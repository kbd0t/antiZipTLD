# 📦🚫 antiZipTLD - Feel a little bit more safe
### With this extension you can give yourself a 1 step more before visiting **.zip** domains (which may contain malware).
## 🚧 How does it work?
This extension will check if the domain you are visiting ends with .zip. If it does, it will show you a warning message. If you click on the *I accept the risk* button, you will be redirected to the website.
## 😐 *Why would I need this?*

## Options
In the moment of writing this, you can add domains to the whitelist. This means that if you add a domain to the whitelist, you will not see the warning message when you visit that domain, you can remove domains from the whitelist, and completely **disable** the extension. (temporarily for safety reasons), all of this can be accessed when clicking at the icon of the extension after instalation.
