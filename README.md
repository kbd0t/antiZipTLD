# 📦🚫 antiZipTLD - Feel a little bit more safe
### With this **Chrome** extension you can give yourself a 1 step more before visiting **.zip** domains (which may contain malware).
## 🚧 How does it work?
This extension will check if the domain you are visiting ends with .zip. If it does, it will show you a warning message. If you click on the *I accept the risk* button, you will be redirected to the website.
## 😐 *Why would I need this?*
**[Explanation of why you would need this extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCVJsz7EODA)**
## 💭 How to install
1. Download the code as a zip file
2. Unzip the file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable **Developer mode**
5. Click on **Load unpacked**
6. Select the folder you unzipped
7. Enjoy!
## 💭 How to uninstall
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click on the **Remove** button
3. Done!

## ⚙ Options
In the moment of writing this, you can add domains to the whitelist. This means that if you add a domain to the whitelist, you will not see the warning message when you visit that domain, you can remove domains from the whitelist, and completely **disable** the extension. (temporarily for safety reasons), all of this can be accessed when clicking at the icon of the extension after instalation.

## ❗ Will it ever be available for Firefox or [insert here any other non-chromium browser]?
I don't know, I myself use Brave, which is based on Chromium, and making it available for other browsers would be hard for me, but if you want to make it available for other browsers, you can fork this repository and make it available for other browsers, just make sure to give me credit for the original code. (or you can just open pull requests with the modified code for other browsers)
